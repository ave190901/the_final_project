# the_final_project
The final project of learning. 
The theme is a game of bulls and cows
The point of the game is to guess the number by the number of bulls and cows at each step. 
The program has the ability to select the number of digits in the number that will be guessed. 
There is a record of the history of attempts. Added a restart of the game, which does not require exiting the program.
